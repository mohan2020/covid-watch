      text1: In 2017, we completed a [randomized controlled trial](https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/27/11/871.long) comparing Heart Safe Motherhood to the usual care of one-time, office-based blood pressure checks. 
      text2: We found an increase in our ability to obtain at least one blood pressure within ten days of discharge in 92% of patients using text messaging, compared to 44% in usual care.  We met ACOG guidelines in 80% of our patients.  Readmissions dropped to zero percent among remote monitored women in the trial. 
      text3: Heart Safe Motherhood not only enables real-time notification of severely elevated blood pressures, but also sheds light on blood pressure trends over time and allows providers to request additional blood pressure readings to follow-up on medication changes.  By adapting algorithms from office visit care, we are able safely to start antihypertensive medications remotely prior to the development of morbidity and direct the right women to in-person care at the right time.

      text:  Providers focus on the information they need to know through alerts and dashboards.  Providers are alerted only when blood pressures are high enough to necessitate intervention.
    - title: Real-world expertise
      text: The Heart Safe Motherhood approach to patient identification, education, engagement, monitoring, and management was developed over four years to maximize impact, convenience, ease of use, and patient safety.
    - title: Continual innovation
      text: Heart Safe Motherhood is continuously evolving as we find new ways to engage patients, improve provider experience, and maximize impact through real-world implementations and innovative research.
